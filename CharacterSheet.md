Mission:
1. Go to Strillitzia : festival in a few weeks, be the delegration for NAM, instill a sense of trust. Lunar Festival.

Shadowy form passes underneath. Headed south. Not in a hurry. Absolutely massive. 

A distress flare appears next to us. Our directive is to go help when there is an emergency. 

Just left Tharsis

Alignment of the Planets (Parade) we are ahead of this by 2 weeks. 

Gavin Newson
Balthamos Morgenthau
Lady Harrington 

Prisoners Missing -> Forbidden from Asking: low-level offenses are not coming out. (disappear and never come back)

Sam Slickshot -> slickshot.

Noble's Conversation:
`Thaugh is trying to convince Harrington, and Newsom to build aqueducts and other water infrastructure. 

Someone else wants to just exapand the city: knock down the wall and expand in that direction. 
Lady Fanewrath
Ambrosia Cunningham
Filosia Flabbergast
King Bulivar 

-> pirate attacks for several months. 

Breakfast
Morganthau (Public works) and Phillova (king's wizard at hand -- power of her being) are in the dining room when we arrive.
- Philova wanted to see us have us hand off a package (Hillport) (fungal being) "Fungi" Old an intelligent micheonid (very old and has lots of information)
- Silver mine in Valshire
- Book to Hillport 

Fire is a good choice against michonid, but avoid all the spores. 


-> Newsom having secret meetings and book was stolen
-> We are walking to get weapons and hear a heated converstation : Harrington and Feynwrath, frustrated on the same topic. 
-> (Complaining about kind not being hard enough on certain issues)(Trusting other Nobles.) Feynwrath lost access to silvermine to morganthau. 
-> Found and eye with an R on it on book thief. 
-> Many Chariots full of prisoners on separate beach belonging to Harrington - on a fancier ship.
-> sealed carriages without any widows 

-> Orca and Bear Masks 
-> Backup is being called because the pirates have realized we have killed their mates 
-> Sorcerer Chameleon 
-> Bear mask greatly improves the strength but is also super evil. 
-> Sword accept gold 1:1 adds +1 damage and changes to magic radiant damage 
-> We are at day 10.
